# FOFB Linear Amplifier Board

The Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB) Linear Amplifier board is a fast current power source designed to drive the corrector magnets distributed through the storage ring. It is part of the Fast Orbit Correction system for the brazilian 4th generation synchrotron light source (Sirius). It consists of a MicroTCA Rear Transition Module (RTM) capable of driving up to 12 current channels synchronously and delivering up to 1A per channel.
